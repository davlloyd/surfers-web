# Surf Lookout

Looking at the viability of creating a Surf report web site, including Live CAMs. This has been motiviated by the fact that all local sites here in Sydney now have enforced a charge model for what is typically low quality reporting with CAM feeds from public cameras.

Language:   Python (initially)

## To Do
- Add authentication to bring user context to the app
- Site specific information  to add
    - Weather
    - Tide
    - Wave buoy informtion
- Add chat forum, location aligned (and general chat?)
- Add information into panels to allow users to customise their own page layouts
- Enable session context to be externalised to Redis (flask-session module maybe?)
- Add map based navigation
- Add admin screen to allow locations to be added/managed via web UI
